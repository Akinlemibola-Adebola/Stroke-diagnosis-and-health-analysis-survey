# Introduction
Stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. As global life expectancy rises, understanding the contributing factors to stroke has become more critical than ever. This project aims to analyze a health dataset comprising 10,000 individuals to uncover the relationships between stroke occurrence and variables such as age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and socio-economic status.
This report provides data-driven insights that can support healthcare professionals and policymakers in designing effective stroke prevention and early intervention strategies.

# Objectives
- To identify the key demographic and health-related risk factors associated with stroke
- To explore which groups (age, gender, income level, health condition) are most vulnerable
- To support proactive health interventions by highlighting high-risk individuals
- To visualize the correlation between chronic conditions and stroke prevalence.

# Importance of the Analysis
This analysis holds real-world value in both public health and clinical settings:
- Targeted Prevention: By pinpointing who is most at risk, healthcare providers can focus interventions where they’re needed most.
- Resource Allocation: Helps health institutions plan for high-risk populations and manage resources better.
- Public Awareness: Raises awareness on how lifestyle and underlying health conditions impact stroke risk.
- Policy Development: Supports evidence-based strategies for stroke prevention programs and screening efforts.

# Observations
- Total Population: 10,000
- Average Age: 70
- Average BMI: 28.05 kg/m²
- Predominant Condition: Hypertension (60.5%)

Demographics
- Gender: Male – 5,037, Female – 4,963

Age Groups distribution
- 25–45: 52 people
- 46–60: 1,566
- 61–75: 5,414
- 76–90: 2,968

Health Conditions
- Hypertension: 6,058
- Heart disease: 3,028
- Diabetes: 1,960
- Stroke cases: 2,87

Stroke-positive patients
- With hypertension: 2,673 (93%)
- With heart disease: 1,478 (51%)
- With diabetes: 648 (22.5%)

Stroke Rate by Age
- 25–45: 0.03%
- 46–60: 4.57%
- 61–75: 44.16%
- 76–90: 51.24%

Socioeconomic Status (of stroke-positive patients)
- Medium Income: 1,563
- Low Income: 799
- High Income: 616

# Key insights
- Stroke is strongly age-related, with over 95% of cases occurring in individuals aged 61–90.
- Hypertension is the most common comorbidity, with nearly all stroke patients having high blood pressure.
- Stroke prevalence is higher in individuals with BMI ≥ 30, suggesting a risk correlation with obesity.
- Heart disease and low to medium income levels are significantly associated with stroke cases.
- Only a small fraction of strokes occurred in people under 60, showing a clear age-related trend.

# Data-Driven Recommendations
- Prioritize health screenings for individuals aged 60 and above, especially those with hypertension or obesity.
- Launch targeted lifestyle interventions (e.g., dietary guidance, physical activity) for individuals with BMI ≥ 30.
- Focus community outreach in low and medium-income groups with education on managing heart and metabolic health.
- Improve blood pressure and cardiovascular monitoring, especially among known hypertensive and diabetic patients.
- Encourage early preventive care to reduce stroke risk in at-risk populations before symptoms escalate.

# Conclusion
- The stroke analysis highlights a clear correlation between age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and socioeconomic status with stroke risk. Most stroke patients are elderly, hypertensive, and often from lower-income backgrounds. These insights provide a strong foundation for designing preventive health measures that prioritize early detection and lifestyle modifications. Implementing data-driven policies could significantly reduce the burden of stroke, especially in vulnerable populations.
